h4. Installation

Install the plugin by adding the following to your @BuildConfig.groovy@:

{code}
plugins {
    ...
    compile ":groovations:${groovationsVersion}"
    ...
}
{code}

Create a new directory called @'scripts/groovy-migrations'@ if it does not already exist.
This directory is where the plugin will look to find Groovy scripts.
