The @resourcePath@ of a script is the file path of the script resource, relative to the grails project directory.
The execution order of the scripts is determined using the @resourcePaths@ of the scripts.
Scripts are sorted lexicographically by @resourcePath@ and executed in the sorted order.
Users of the plugin are free to decide upon a directory and filename convention to obtain the desired execution order.

Upon request, the plugin asynchronously executes all pending migration scripts in order.

Should an exception occur during the execution of a migration script, the plugin will *not* execute the remaining pending migrations.
The plugin catches exceptions from migration scripts and logs them at the @error@ level.
