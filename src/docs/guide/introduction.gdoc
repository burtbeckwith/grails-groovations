Automatically run Groovy based migration scripts.

Grails console scripts are powerful tools for performing data migrations, since they have access to business logic and domain classes.
Running these scripts manually means that sometimes these scripts do not get run on all environments and there is no visibility into what
scripts have been run or need to be run.

This plugin was created to automate the script execution process and provide visibility and consistency.
